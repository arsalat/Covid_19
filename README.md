The goal of this project is to analyze the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths for the state of connecticut. The data spans from March 2020 to Apr 2021. To make our analysis easier, we will be analyzing data from May 2020 to Feb 2021.

We will attemp to answer a few questions here:

In which month did the most cases and deaths occured?
What percentage of people died compared the number of confirmed cases?
What percentage of people were hospitalized?
Which age groups were most vulnerable to the virus?
Which age group is most likely to die from covid-19? Are we doing any better this year than the last year?
What is the probability of having covid-19 given that you get a Covid-19 test? This will give us a measure of the test reliability.
What is the probability of getting hospitalized if you have a confirmed case of covid-19?
What is the probability of dying from covid-19?
